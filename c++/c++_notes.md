## 2.4.4  Constant expressions and Constexpr
----
## Constant expression
### 1. definition
- **An expression whose value cannot change and evaluated at compile time.**
- A `const` object that is initialized from a constant expression is a constant expression.
- types and the initializer determines whether an object or expression is a constant expression.
### 2. examples
	const int foo = 20; //foo is a constant expression
	int bar = 21; // bar is not a constant expression
bar is initialized from a literal, but it is pure `int`, not the `const int`.

---
	const int size = getSize(); // size is not a constant expression

value of the `size` is unknown until run time.

---

## Constexpr Variables
### 1. Definition
- **Asking** the compiler to verify if a variable is a constant expression.
###why?
In large system, it can be confusing to determine whether an initializer is a constant expression or not. We might define a constant variable with an initializer that is *NOT* a constant expression. 

### 2. examples
	constexpr int var = 20;// 20 is a constant expression
	constexpr int limit = var + 1; // var + 1 is a constant expression
	constexpr int sz = size(); // ok only if size is a constexpr function.

### 3. constexpr functions
- must be **simple enough** that the compiler can evaluate them at compile time.
- can use in the initializer of a `constexpr` variable.

####Best Paractices
Use `constexpr` for variables that you *intend to* use as constant expressions.


----

### 4. Literal Types

- Literal types are simple enough to use in a `constexpr` 
- `constexpr` objects to initialize **pointers** and **reference** are strictly limited
	+ can initialize `constexpr` pointer from the `nullptr` or 0.
	+ can point to an object : remains at a fixed address
		* ordinarily variables defined inside a function are not fixed.
		* cover in ยง6.1.1

	+ can point to ( bind to ) an object that remains at a fixed address.
		* varialbed defined *inside* a function -> address not fixed
		* object defined *outside* of any function -> constant expression
		* special local objects  ( see in ยง 6.1.1 ) function like an object defined outside any function, these special local objects also have fixed addresses.

---

### 5. Pointers and `constexpr`

#### Different to a pointer to const

- the `constexpr` specifier *applies to the pointer* , not the*type* to which the pointer points

		const int *p = nullptr; // p is a pointer to a const int
		constexpr int *q = nullptr; // q is a const pointer to int

- p : pointer to const
- q : constant pointer
- `constexpr` imposes a top-level const

---

#### Similar to constant pointer

- `constexpr` pointer may point to a const *or* a nonconst type

		constexpr int *np = nullptr;	// np is a onstant pointer to int
		int j = 0;
		constexpr int i = 42;		//type of i is const int
					// i and j must be defined outside any function
	    constexpr const int *p = &i; 	// p is a constnt pointer to the const int i
    	constexpr int *p1 = &j;		// p1 is a constant pointer to the int j




# 2.5. Dealing with Types

----

## 2.5.1. Type Aliases

### 1. Definition
- A synonym for another type
- Emphasize the purpose for which a type is used

**2 ways to do this :**

### 2. `typedef`

	typedef double wages;	// wages is a synonym for double
	typedef wages base, *p;	// base is a synonym for double, p for double*

### 3. `alias` declaration

	using SI = Sales_item;		// SI is a synonym for Sales_item

- Starts with the `using`
- then alias name and `=` 


----

### 4. Pointers, `const`, and Type Aliases

Declarations that use **type aliases** that represent compound types and `const` can yield *distracting* results.

- example : type `pstring` : alias for the type `char*`

		typedef char *pstring; 

		const pstring cstr = 0; // cstr is a constant pointer to char
		const pstring *ps; 	// ps is a pointer to a constant pointer to char

base type in both :  `const pstring`
 
`const` that appears in the base type modifies the given type.

- the type of `pstring` : **pointer to char** 
- `const pstring` : **constant pointer to char**, **not a pointer to const char**

#### confusing!

`const char* cstr` : pointer to const char.
`const pstring cstr` : constant pointer to char.

NOT correct : interpreting a type alias by *replacing * the alias type like this:

	const char* cstr = 0;	//wrong interpretation of const pstring cstr
				// cstr is a pointer to const char

`pstring` in declaration : 
Using `pstring` in a declaration, the base type of the declaration is a pointer type. Otherwise, when we rewrite the declaration using char*, the base type is char and the * is part of the declarator, const char is the base type. thus, this rewrite declares `cstr` as a pointer to `const char` rather than as a `const` pointer to `char`. 


## 2.5.2. `auto` Type Specifier

not uncommon : store the value of an expression in a var
to do this _ have to know the type of that expression.

this can be *surpsisingly* difficult. 

with the `auto`, we can let the compiler figure out the type
- `auto` tells the compiler to deduce the type from the initializer.
	* this implies a variable that uses `auto` as ity type specifier must have na initializer

			// the type of item is deduced from the type of the result of adding val1, val2
		auto item  = val1 + val2;	// item initialized to the result of val1 + val2

- compiler will deduce the type of `item` from the type returned by applying `+` to `val1`, `val2`

---

### multiple definition 

- declaration can invole only a single base type
- all the vars in the declaration **must** have types that are **consistent**

		auto i = 0, *p = &i;	//ok, i is int, p is a pointer to int
		auto foo = 0, bar = 3.14;	//error : inconsistent type

### Compound Types, const

- **the type** that the compiler infers for `auto` is not always same as the initializer's type. 
- the compiler **adjusts the type** to conform to normal initialization rules 

#### when using a reference

- we are really using the object to which the reference refers.
- reference as an *initializer* , the initializer is the *correspondig object* .

		int i = 0, &r = i;
		auto a = r;		// a is an int ( corresponding to r is i, which is int)

----
####`const`s

- low-level `const`s ( an initializer is a pointer to `const`) are kept
		const int ci = i, &cr = ci;
		auto b = ci;	// b is an  int (top-level const dropped)
		auto c = cr; 	// c is an int ( cr is an alias for ci)
		
		auto d = &i; 	// d is an int* ( & of an int object: int*)
		auto e = &ci; 	// e is const int* ( & of a acont object is low-level const)


- want to deduced type to have a top-level `const` : 
		const auto f = ci; 	//deduced type of ci is int;

-----

- want a reference to the `auto`-deduced type : 
		auto &g = ci;	// g is a const int& that is bound to ci
		auto &h = 42; 	// err: cannot bind a plain reference to a literal
		const auto &j = 42;	// can bind a const reference to a literal
- Asking for a reference to an `auto`-deduced type, top-level `const`s in the initializer are not ignored. : `const`s are not top-level when we bind a reference to an initializer.


#### attention:

- a reference or pointer is part of a particular declarator, not part of the base type for the declarations

		auto k = ci, &l = i; 	// k is int, l is int& 
		auto &m = ci, *p = &ci;	// m is a const int& , p is a pointer to const int
		auto &n = i, *p2 = &ci;	// err : type deduced from i is int, deduced from &ci is const int.
